# Liquid Soap Factory - Chemical Prototyping

Interactive React web model for liquid soap manufacturing process through saponification.

## Features

- Interactive factory layout with clickable equipment
- Real-time process information
- Material flow visualization
- Chemical reaction details
- Responsive design

## Installation

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## Process Stages

1. **Raw Material Storage** - Storage tanks for all ingredients
2. **Mixing Reactor** - Combines oils and alkali solution
3. **Saponification** - Chemical reaction occurs (Oil + KOH → Soap + Glycerin)
4. **Filtration** - Removes impurities
5. **Final Storage** - Quality controlled final product

## Materials Used

- Castor Oil: 10ml
- Distilled Water: 40ml
- NaOH: 5gm
- Glycerol: 10ml
- NaCl: 5gm
- NaHCO₃: 5gm

## Chemical Reaction

Fat/Oil + KOH → Soap + Glycerin
C₃H₅(OCOR)₃ + 3KOH → 3RCOOK + C₃H₅(OH)₃
